An overview of packages that may be used in this assignment can be found in the file 'environment.yaml'.\n",
    "* Ensure your definitions (functions, classes, methods, variables) follow the specification if\n",
    "  given. The concrete signature and header of a function is usually specified in the task description and via code skeletons.\n",
    "* Again, make sure that all your function as well as variable names match with what we have specified! The automated grading will only match these exact names, and everything that can not be matched will not be graded.\n",
    "* Whenever there is a written task, e.g. task 1b), enter your answer in the specified markdown cell. Do NOT remove or edit the label (e.g. '__A1b):__' ) from the markdown cell, as this will have to be parsed by the grading system and matched to your answer. \n",
    "* Ensure the notebook does not rely on current notebook or system state!\n",
    "  * Use `Kernel --> Restart & Run All` to see if you are using any definitions, variables etc. that \n",
    "    are not in scope anymore.\n",
    "  * Do not rename any of the datasets you use, and load it from the same directory that your ipynb-notebook is located in, i.e., your working directory. In particular, when loading your file via a pandas or numpy command, make sure that it has the form `nx.read_edgelist(\"example.edgelist\")` instead of `nx.read_edgelist(\"C:/User/Path/to/your/Homework/example.edgelist\")` so that the code directly works from our machines.\n",
    "* Make sure that your code is executable, any task for which the code does not directly run on our machine will be graded with 0 points. Run your notebook from top to bottom, make sure there is no error!\n",
    "  Minimize usage of global variables. Do not reuse variable names multiple times!\n",
    "* Ensure your code/notebook terminates in reasonable time.\n",
