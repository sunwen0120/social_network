An overview of packages that may be used in this assignment can be found in the file 'environment.yaml'.\n",

    "  given. The concrete signature and header of a function is usually specified in the task description and via code skeletons.\n",
    "* Again, make sure that all your function as well as variable names match with what we have specified! The automated grading will only match these exact names, and everything that can not be matched will not be graded.\n",
    "* Whenever there is a written task, e.g. task 1b), enter your answer in the specified markdown cell. Do NOT remove or edit the label (e.g. '__A1b):__' ) from the markdown cell, as this will have to be parsed by the grading system and matched to your answer. \n",
    "* Ensure the notebook does not rely on current notebook or system state!\n",
    "  * Use `Kernel --> Restart & Run All` to see if you are using any definitions, variables etc. that \n",
    "    are not in scope anymore.\n",
    "  * Do not rename any of the datasets you use, and load it from the same directory that your ipynb-notebook is located in, i.e., your working directory. In particular, when loading your file, make sure that it has the form `nx.read_edgelist(\"example.edgelist\")` instead of `nx.read_edgelist(\"C:/User/Path/to/your/Homework/example.edgelist\")` so that the code directly works from our machines.\n",
    "* Make sure that your code is executable, any task for which the code does not directly run on our machine will be graded with 0 points. Run your notebook from top to bottom, make sure there is no error!\n",
    "  Minimize usage of global variables. Do not reuse variable names multiple times!\n",

    "Recall that the algorithm takes as input a graph, on which edge pairs are going to be rewired for a fixed number of steps. Each of the rewiring steps should use the following procedure:\n",
    "* two random edges are drawn, and their incident nodes are labeled a, b ,c , and d so that $k_a \\geq k_b \\geq k_c \\geq k_d$.\n",
    "* with a given probability $p$, the edges are rewired to make the network more (dis)assortative, following the procedure in the next step. Otherwise, the edges are rewired at random.\n",
    "* When aiming for an assortative network, we rewire the edges such that $a$ joins $b$ and $c$ joins $d$. Otherwise, we join $a$ with $d$ and $b$ with $c$.\n",
    "* To avoid self-loops and multiedges, we redraw the edges and repeat the current step if the two drawn edges share a node, or if the rewiring would yield an edge that already exists in the network (but has not been drawn for rewiring). Note that in the implementation we impose a limit on how often we try to resample if such a case occurs.\n",
